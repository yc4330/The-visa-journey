            <p class="subhead">This journey is based on interviews and real stories of Chinese students who had their
                visa canceled and repatriated while studying in the US.</p>

        <p>Over the last three months, more than a dozen PhD students from renowned colleges, including Yale and Johns
            Hopkins, have been denied re-entry to the country, with some facing a five-year-ban. For some students, this
            means stepping out of the PhD program entirely.
        </p>
        <p>The students have been trying to figure out why their visas were canceled without notice. Appealing has not
            given them a clear answer. Some believe it is due to the aftermath of the China Initiative and President
            Proclamation 10043, which aimed to ferret out spies from the science community.
        </p>
        <p>If you are a Chinese student coming to the U.S for graduate school, what choices would you make when faced
            with the uncertainty of visa validity? Take this journey to understand the feeling of increased scrutiny at
            the border.</p>

                <p>Being a female graduate student may result in a greater chance of having her visa canceled.</p>

                    occurred during the winter of 2023 only involved female students.
                </p>
                <p>However, male students were also included in the next batch of repatriated students, which occurred

                </p>
                <p>The “Technology Alert List” is a U.S. State Department document that defines sensitive major fields,
                    which includes most hard sciences such as nuclear technology, physics, engineering, chemistry, and
                    aviation, and others like architecture and urban planning.</p>
                <p>However, three of the four students being repatriated in half a month are from the non-sensitive
                    major.
                </p>
                <p>Many of the blocked students are studying medicine or biology, such as MRI medical imaging. This
                    could be
                    due to the NIH's investigation of undisclosed foreign ties to NIH grants.

                <p>On January 29, the Chinese Embassy in the United States delivered a message that particularly pointed
                    out
                    Dulles International Airport. Chinese students are advised to carefully select their airport to
                    prevent
                    "unwarranted interrogation, harassment, and even repatriation" by border officers.

        <p>You hold the box and follow him to the second inspection region, a place you've never heard of. It’s similar
            to the check-in counter, but with rows of chairs in the hall.
        </p>
        <p>You sit and wait after a flight over 10 hours, alone. You can not use any electronic devices, which are
            preserved and checked by the officer.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, you're called in for a second round of questioning. “Do you need a translator?” The officer asked.

            <p>When deciding to not use the translator, they were not aware that their visas were being canceled
